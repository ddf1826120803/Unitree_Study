CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package):
  By not providing "Findunitree_sdk2.cmake" in CMAKE_MODULE_PATH this project
  has asked CMake to find a package configuration file provided by
  "unitree_sdk2", but CMake did not find one.

  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "unitree_sdk2" with
  any of the following names:

    unitree_sdk2Config.cmake
    unitree_sdk2-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "unitree_sdk2" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "unitree_sdk2_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If
  "unitree_sdk2" provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it
  has been installed.
